                <p> Porcelain. It’s the sturdiest type of ceramic that is fired at the highest temperatures. It has a glassy finish and it’s more expensive than both stoneware and earthware </p>

                <p> Glass. Many stylish coffee cups are made of heat-resistant glass. The disadvantage to using this material for drinkware is the fact that it doesn’t hold heat as well as ceramic.</p>

                <p> The classic espresso cup is a small 2 oz. to 3 oz. cup and is made of ceramic or porcelain.</p>

                <p> Plastic. Plastic cups and mugs are usually made of polypropylene or melamine. The former is microwave-safe while the latter isn’t.</p>

        <p> Smart mugs work by keeping your coffee, or whatever hot beverage, at a certain temperature for a period of time. For someone who tends to take a while to finish a cup of coffee, smart mugs have always seemed like a worthwhile purchase. <br>&mdash Tyler Chin</br></p>
